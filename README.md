About Me

I'm a data-driven professional currently working as a BI Analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis and a growing interest in data science. I'm proficient in Tableau, Python, SQL, and Excel, and I'm eager to apply my skills to solve challenging problems and build impactful solutions.

My recent project, 'Forecasting Tool for Swing Trading', demonstrates my ability to leverage data to create practical applications.

I'm a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong work ethic and a desire to continuously learn and grow. I'm open to collaboration and eager to connect with other data professionals and contribute to the open-source community.
